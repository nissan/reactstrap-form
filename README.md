# reactstrap form example with controlled components

This is an example of a form with controlled components that was built with react, redux and [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) (not using redux-form)

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to  bootstrap the project.

It has been deployed to heroku with [Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) [here](https://reactstrap-form.herokuapp.com/).

For testing on your system, clone it and rename the folder name to 'form'.
